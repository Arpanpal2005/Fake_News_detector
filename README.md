# Fake_News_detector
This project is an end-to-end Fake News Detection System built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning.
It analyzes the textual content of news articles and predicts whether the information is Real or Fake, based on linguistic patterns, semantic cues, and model-learned features.
The goal is to reduce misinformation by applying modern NLP techniques to classify suspicious or unreliable news content.
